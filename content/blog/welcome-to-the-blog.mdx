## Welcome! 🎉

We're excited to introduce our new blog powered by **MDX** and **Next.js**. This platform combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

## Key Features

Our blog comes packed with modern features:

### 1. MDX Support

Write content in Markdown with the ability to import and use React components inline. This gives you the best of both worlds.

### 2. Static Site Generation

All blog posts are statically generated at build time using Next.js `generateStaticParams`, ensuring blazing-fast page loads.

### 3. Syntax Highlighting

Beautiful code syntax highlighting powered by `rehype-pretty-code`:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  date: string;
  tags?: string[];
  excerpt?: string;
}

function getAllPosts(): BlogPost[] {
  // Read and parse MDX files
  return posts.sort((a, b) => b.date.localeCompare(a.date));
}
```

### 4. GitHub Flavored Markdown

We support **GFM** extensions including:

- ✅ Task lists
- 📊 Tables
- 🔗 Auto-linking
- ~~Strikethrough~~

Here's a table example:

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| MDX | ✅ Complete | High |
| Code Highlighting | ✅ Complete | High |
| Image Optimization | ✅ Complete | Medium |
| Dark Mode | ✅ Complete | Medium |

### 5. Auto-linked Headings

All headings automatically get anchor links, making it easy to share specific sections.

### 6. Image Optimization

Images are automatically optimized using Next.js `Image` component:

```typescript
// In your MDX
import coverImage from './welcome-to-the-blog/cover.jpg'

<Image src={coverImage} alt="Blog cover" />
```

### 7. SEO & Metadata

Each post can define:

- **Title** and **description** for meta tags
- **Open Graph** images for social sharing
- **Canonical URLs** to avoid duplicate content
- **Tags** for categorization

## Writing Your First Post

Creating a new post is easy with our CLI tool:

```bash
pnpm new:post "Your Awesome Title"
```

This will:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file with frontmatter
2. Set up a folder for images
3. Mark the post as a draft
4. Generate a URL-friendly slug

## Frontmatter Structure

Every post needs frontmatter metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
slug: your-post-title
date: 2025-11-02
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
excerpt: A brief description
draft: false
---
```

## Draft Mode

Posts marked with `draft: true` are:

- ✅ Visible in development mode
- ❌ Hidden from production builds
- ⚠️ Show a warning banner when viewed locally

## Performance

Our blog is built for speed:

- Static generation for instant page loads
- Optimized images with automatic WebP conversion
- Minimal JavaScript for fast interactivity
- Edge-ready for global CDN deployment

## What's Next?

We're continuously improving the blog. Upcoming features:

- 🔍 Full-text search
- 📱 RSS feed
- 💬 Comments integration
- 🏷️ Tag filtering
- 📖 Reading time estimates

## Conclusion

We're thrilled to have this MDX blog up and running. It combines powerful developer tools with a great authoring experience.

**Happy blogging!** 🚀
