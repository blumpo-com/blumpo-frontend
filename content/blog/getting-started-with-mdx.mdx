## What is MDX?

**MDX** is a format that lets you use JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import and use React components within your content, making it incredibly powerful for technical documentation and blogs.

## Why Use MDX?

### 1. Best of Both Worlds

You get the **simplicity of Markdown** for writing content and the **flexibility of React** for interactive elements.

### 2. Component Reusability

Write components once, use them across multiple posts:

```jsx
<Alert type="warning">
  This is an important warning!
</Alert>
```

### 3. No HTML Limitations

Unlike pure Markdown, you're not limited to basic HTML. You can create rich, interactive experiences.

## Basic Syntax

MDX supports all standard Markdown:

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

### Lists

Unordered lists:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Ordered lists:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Blockquotes

> "MDX is the future of content-driven development."
> — Every developer who tries it

## Using Components in MDX

Here's where MDX shines. You can import and use React components:

```mdx
import { CustomButton } from './components/Button'

# My Post

Here's some content with a custom button:

<CustomButton onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>
  Click Me
</CustomButton>
```

## Code Blocks

MDX supports syntax-highlighted code blocks:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // 55
```

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from Python!")
    
hello_world()
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

## Tables

MDX fully supports GitHub Flavored Markdown tables:

| Language | Popularity | Year Created |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| JavaScript | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 1995 |
| TypeScript | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 2012 |
| Python | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 1991 |
| Rust | ⭐⭐⭐ | 2010 |

## Task Lists

- [x] Understand JSX
- [ ] Master MDX
- [ ] Build something awesome

## Frontmatter

Every MDX post should include frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
slug: your-post-slug
date: 2025-10-15
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
excerpt: Brief description
draft: false
---
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Simple

Don't overuse components. Let Markdown do the heavy lifting for content.

### 2. Use TypeScript

Type your components for better DX:

```typescript
interface AlertProps {
  type: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error';
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function Alert({ type, children }: AlertProps) {
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Optimize Images

Always use Next.js `Image` component:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'
import heroImage from './hero.jpg'

<Image 
  src={heroImage} 
  alt="Hero" 
  width={800} 
  height={400}
/>
```

### 4. Test Your Components

Make sure components work in both MDX and regular React:

```tsx
// Can be used in MDX and .tsx files
export function CodeBlock({ children, language }) {
  return (
    <pre>
      <code className={`language-${language}`}>
        {children}
      </code>
    </pre>
  );
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Callout Boxes

```jsx
<div className="callout callout-info">
  💡 **Tip:** MDX processes JSX at build time, not runtime.
</div>
```

### Embedded Videos

```jsx
<div className="video-container">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>
```

### Interactive Demos

```jsx
<InteractiveDemo
  initialCode="console.log('Hello!');"
  language="javascript"
/>
```

## Debugging MDX

Common issues and solutions:

### 1. JSX Syntax Errors

Make sure your JSX is properly formatted:

```mdx
❌ Bad:
<Component prop="value">

✅ Good:
<Component prop="value" />
```

### 2. Import Paths

Use relative paths for local components:

```mdx
import { Button } from '../components/Button'
```

### 3. Blank Lines

MDX can be picky about blank lines. When in doubt, add them:

```mdx
## Heading

Some text here.

<Component />

More text here.
```

## Resources

Here are some helpful resources for learning MDX:

- [MDX Official Docs](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Next.js MDX Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx)
- [MDX Playground](https://mdxjs.com/playground/)

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful tool for content creators who want more flexibility than Markdown offers but don't want to write full HTML. It's perfect for:

- Technical blogs
- Documentation sites
- Portfolio pages
- Course materials
- Landing pages

Start with simple Markdown, add components as needed, and you'll have a powerful content system that scales with your needs.

**Happy writing!** ✍️
