### Introduction

With over **4 billion searches per day**, Google remains arguably the world’s largest advertising platform. Marketers who master its ad formats, targeting options and conversion mechanics often realize **10–20% higher ROAS** than average search benchmarks. In 2025, ad spec changes, AI automation and evolving consumer behavior make continuous optimization more vital than ever.

- Description: up to 90 characters (2 descriptions)
- URL paths: up to 15 chars each
- Important to craft clear benefit + keyword match.

---

### 2.2 Display Ads

**Specs:**

- Sizes (classic): 300×250, 336×280, 728×90, 300×600, 320×100, 970×250
- Responsive Display: upload multiple assets (image, logo, headline, description) — Google assembles creative.
- Max file size: 150 KB for image assets.
- Formats: JPG, PNG, GIF (if simple animation).

**When to use:** Prospecting, remarketing, awareness campaigns.

**Pro tip:** Use responsive display ads for scale + dynamic remarketing for personalised impact.

---

### 2.3 Video Ads (YouTube / Video partners)

**Specs:**

- TrueView in-stream: skippable after 5 seconds, recommended length 15–30 seconds.
- Bumper ads: 6 seconds non-skippable.
- Max file size: 1 GB (often less).
- Formats: 9:16 landscape standard for YouTube, but vertical (9:16) for mobile placements.

**When to use:** Brand awareness, product launches, storytelling.

**Pro tip:** First 5 seconds must hook; provide clear CTA and use companion banners for reinforcement.

---

### 2.4 Shopping & Discovery Ads

**Specs:**

- Shopping: product feed required with attributes (title, price, availability, image).
- Image specs: min 600×600 px recommended.

---

## 3. Strategy: Search vs Display vs Video

- **Search**: high intent → use for conversions & leads
- **Display**: awareness & retargeting → use for reaching broad audience + bringing them back
- **Video**: brand building + emotional connection → use for hero campaigns and top-of-funnel
- **Shopping/Discovery**: e-commerce direct response → combine with search for full funnel

Budget wise: Many successful marketers follow the “70-20-10” rule:

- 70% search + shopping
- 20% display & remarketing
- 10% video/brand

- Exclude brand spam placements and refine audience segments continually.
