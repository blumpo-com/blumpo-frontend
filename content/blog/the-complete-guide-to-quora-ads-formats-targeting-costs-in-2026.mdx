### **Introduction**

Quora is one of the most underrated advertising platforms on the internet — yet it consistently delivers **high-intent traffic**, excellent **B2B performance**, and some of the **lowest CPCs** of any major ad network.

With around **400 million monthly unique visitors**, Quora has become a go-to resource for users researching solutions, comparing products, and asking questions that often reveal *direct buying intent*.

For brands that rely on education-driven purchase journeys — SaaS, tech, B2B services, consulting, personal development, finance — Quora Ads provides an environment where users are already in “research mode.”

And if you create B2B ads regularly, tools like **Blumpo** can speed up your creative workflow.

**Blumpo generates B2B ads based on real customer insights pulled from your website, Reddit and social channels. To try it out for free, simply drop in your website URL

## **1. Why Advertisers Choose Quora**

### **1. Context + Intent = High-Quality Traffic**

Quora is one of the only platforms where ads appear alongside real questions, discussions and expert answers. This makes targeting extremely precise.

Users come to Quora to:

- research solutions
- compare products
- understand topics deeply
- read expert opinions
- validate a purchase decision

That’s why Quora works especially well for B2B and niche businesses where buyers do homework before converting.

---

### **2. Lower Competition Compared to Meta & Google**

Quora’s ad inventory is far less saturated. This leads to:

- lower CPCs (often starting at ~$0.01–$0.20)
- more stable CPMs
- stronger ROAS in niche verticals
- higher visibility in topic-focused feeds

In crowded markets, Quora can outperform traditional PPC when targeting is aligned to user intent.

---

### **3. Access to Highly Educated, Research-Driven Users**

Studies show Quora users skew toward professionals, decision-makers, and high earners.

This is why SaaS, B2B and knowledge-based companies consistently see strong performance on the platform.

## **2. Quora Ad Formats (2025)**

Quora provides multiple ad formats so you can match creative to your funnel and objective:
